# Reversible Examples
List of reversible examples.

## lt_ex_hello_world.c
A basic example to verify chip functionality and establish a secured session.

## lt_ex_hello_world_separate_API.c
Functionally similar to `lt_ex_hello_world.c`, but uses distinct API calls for incoming and outgoing data. This approach is useful for secure, tunneled communication, used for example during chip provisioning in a factory.

## lt_ex_show_chip_id_and_fw_ver.c
Demonstrates how to read and display the chipâ€™s unique ID and firmware version information (bootloader, application and SPECT firmware versions).

## lt_ex_macandd.c
Illustrates the MAC-and-destroy feature. Refer to the application note and code comments for details.
