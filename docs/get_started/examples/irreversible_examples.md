# Irreversible Examples

To provide better orientation, we highlight specific properties of each example, namely:

- Reversibility,
- Model compatibility,
- Level of complexity (🐣 -> 🐤 -> 🐓).

The source code for the examples can be found in the `examples/` directory and also within this document inside "Source Code" boxes.

!!! tip
    You can copy the example code using the :material-content-copy: icon located in the top-right corner of each source code listing.

## lt_ex_hw_wallet.c
- ⚠️ Irreversible
- ✅ Compatible with the model
- 🐓 Level: Advanced

This example demonstrates how to use configuration objects and different pairing keys to manage access to TROPIC01 features. A hardware wallet device scenario is used as a model for this example.

In this example, you will:

- Understand how the R-config is structured and how permissions are managed using the R-config.
- Learn how the R-config can be modified using the libtropic API:
    - `lt_r_config_erase()`: L3 command to erase the R-config.
    - `lt_write_whole_R_config()`: helper function to write the whole R-config with an instance of `struct lt_config_t`.
    - `lt_read_whole_R_config()`: helper function to read the whole R-config into an instance of `struct lt_config_t`.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you need to modify only one entry in the R-config, you can use `lt_r_config_write()` or `lt_r_config_read()`.
- Learn how to manage pairing keys:
    - `lt_pairing_key_write()`: L3 command to write a pairing key.
    - `lt_pairing_key_invalidate()`: L3 command to invalidate a pairing key.
- Learn how to work with keys based on elliptic curves (ECC) on TROPIC01:
    - `lt_ecc_key_store()`: L3 command to store an ECC key.
    - `lt_ecc_key_read()`: L3 command to read an ECC key.
    - `lt_ecc_key_generate()`: L3 command to generate an ECC key.
- Learn how to use EDDSA to sign messages and verify signatures.
- Learn how to use a monotonic counter.

## lt_ex_fw_update.c
- ⚠️ Irreversible
- ❌ Incompatible with the model
- 🐤 Level: Moderate

This example explains the firmware update process for both ABAB and ACAB silicon revisions. Use this example as a reference for integrating TROPIC01 firmware updates into your application. You will learn:

- How to read the current firmware versions.
- How to update the firmware using `lt_do_mutable_fw_update()`.

!!! tip
    For more information about the firmware itself, refer to the [TROPIC01 Firmware](../tropic01_fw.md) section.
