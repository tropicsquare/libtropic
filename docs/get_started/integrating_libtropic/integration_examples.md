# Integration Examples
We offer so-called *platform repositories*, where libtropic is utilized as a submodule, possibly showing an example of integrating libtropic into your application:

- [libtropic-stm32](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-stm32),
- [libtropic-linux](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-linux).

!!! tip
    These repositories include quick start guides to help you get started quickly with one of the supported platforms.

Beside these repositories, we offer the [libtropic-util](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-util) repository, which implements a CLI based utility for executing TROPIC01's commands.
