# Get Started
!!! bug
    Besides these sections, I would add/integrate something like "Why Use Libtropic?" or "What is Libtropic?". Then something about the directory structure, API, HALs (basic information, the porting guides are in [For Developers](../for_developers/index.md)) and so on. Maybe a step by step what to do after cloning the repository.

This section provides information to help you get started with using libtropic.

- [Libtropic Architecture](libtropic_architecture.md)
- [Adding Libtropic to an Existing Project](adding_to_project.md)
- [Compile Libtropic as a Static Archive](compile_as_static_archive.md)
- [Logging](logging.md)
- [Debugging](debugging.md)

After you get started, we recommend diving into our [Examples](../examples/index.md).
