# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Enhanced internal test runner logging and error reporting.
- Renamed `LT_L2_LAST_RET` to `LT_RET_T_LAST_VALUE` for clarity in `lt_ret_t`.
- Refactored `lt_ex_macandd` example.
- Refactored `lt_ex_hello_world_separate_API` example.

### Added
- Macro `LT_CONFIG_OBJ_CNT` for number of objects in the configuration structure.
- Parameter checks to LT_HELPERS functions.
- Added `LT_NONCE_OVERFLOW` to `lt_ret_t`.

### Fixed
- Assigned value to `LT_L1_CHIP_BUSY` and `LT_L1_INT_TIMEOUT` in `lt_ret_t`, incremented all values starting from `LT_L3_R_MEM_DATA_WRITE_WRITE_FAIL`.
- Added missing `LT_L1_INT_TIMEOUT` in `lt_ret_strs`.
- Chip id parsing in `tests/model_based_project/create_model_cfg.py`
- Fixed nonce overflow vulnerability in lt_l3_nonce_increase, the function now returns `LT_NONCE_OVERFLOW` if the nonce cannot be increased anymore.

### Removed
- Macro `LT_USE_ASSERT`, `assert()` is always inserted.

## [0.1.0]

### Changed

- `ECC_SLOT1-32` numbering changed to `ECC_SLOT_0-31`.
- `lt_handshake()` function renamed to `lt_session_start()`.
- Unit tests and platform tests organization was updated.
- Included `lt_l2_api_structs.h` and `lt_l3_api_structs.h` are automatically generated.
- `SH0` pairing keypair in `keys/keys.c` now reflects engineering samples of TROPIC01 devices.
- Changed logging format in examples.
- Renamed cmake switches: `LT_USE_TREZOR_CRYPTO`, LT_BUILD_DOCS.
- Platform examples are removed - now they are standalone repositories.
- Separated libtropic API calls introduced (session_start and ECC_ECDSA functions):
  - lt_l3.* contain interfaces for encoding l3 data going out and decoding l3 data going in,
  - libtropic.* then wraps l3 functions and does the whole l3 exchange in one round,
  - this change allows user to send data through a tunnel between host and target MCU,
    which then behaves as a relay.
- Separated l2 API calls introduced:
  - Now user can use separate function for sending and receiving data.
- Refactoring of `lt_handle_t` struct:
  - contains separate structs for l2 and l3,
  - allows to split all l2 and l3 calls into separate actions.
- Option to define l3 buffer introduced (`LT_SEPARATE_L3_BUFF`).
- Introduced a new folder `keys/` where user might specify SH0-SH3 keys.
- Remove `lt_serial_code_get()`.
- Rename `LT_L2_STARTUP_ID_MAINTENANCE` to `LT_MODE_MAINTENANCE`.
- Rename `LT_L2_STARTUP_ID_REBOOT` to `LT_MODE_APP`.
- Code formatted with `clang-format` version 16 is now enforced on push to branch.
- Add `LT_PRINT_SPI_DATA` - used to debug print low level communication.
- Moved logging and assert macros to `libtropic_logging.h` (they were defined twice in
files `libtropic_examples.h`, `libtropic_functional_tests.h`).
- Instead of using `LT_ADD_FUNC_TESTS` and `LT_BUILD_TESTS`, use only `LT_BUILD_TESTS`.
- Rename `LT_ADD_EXAMPLES` to `LT_BUILD_EXAMPLES` to be consistent with `LT_BUILD_TESTS`
  and `LT_BUILD_DOCS`.
- Always increment host's nonce in `lt_l3_decrypt_response()`.
- When `LT_BUILD_EXAMPLES` or `LT_BUILD_TESTS` are set, CMake requires to define `LT_SH0_PRIV_PATH`.
- Removed SH0 keys and pkey_index_{0,1,2,3} from `keys/keys.c` and reflected it in examples, tests.
- Added writing of pairing keys to slots 1,2,3 in `lt_test_ping` and created `lt_test_engineering_sample_01_ping` from the old version of `lt_test_ping`.
- Set default value to `LT_SH0_PRIV_PATH`.

### Added

- L3 commands: MCounter (init, update and get), MAC-and-destroy.
- L2 commands: Resend, Sleep and Log req.
- libtropic API: lt_update_mode().
- Example folder and test folder is reworked.
- Option LT_ADD_EXAMPLES controls if example's folder code is a part of compilation.
- Option LT_ADD_FUNC_TESTS controls if code from tests/functional/ folder will be compiled-in.
- Port/ support and tests/platform/ example for Raspberry Pi.
- Added macro `LT_USE_ASSERT`, based on which `assert()` is inserted into `LT_ASSERT` and `LT_ASSERT_COND`.
- Added CTest handling for functional tests.
- Added `SESSION_OFF` for indicating that secure session is off and assigned it to `lt_l3_state_t.session` flag in `lt_init()`.
- Added function `lt_l3_invalidate_host_session_data()`, which sets all data in `lt_l3_state_t` to zero and `session` to `SESSION_OFF`; it is called in `lt_session_abort` and when ciphering/deciphering of L3 command fails (wrong TAG).
- Added CMake variable `LT_SH0_PRIV_PATH`, based on which `sh0_keys.c` is generated for examples or tests, so sh0priv and sh0pub are defined.
- Added CTest handling for functional tests run against TROPIC01 model.

### Fixed

- Return values for L3 API
