/**
 * @brief Establishes Secure Session and executes Ping L3 command using separated API.
 *
 * This example shows how to use separated API calls with TROPIC01. Separate calls are named lt_out__* and
 * lt_in__* and they provide splitting of the commands/results, which might be used for example for communication over a
 * tunnel. Let's say we want to speak with TROPIC01 from a server, then lt_out__* part is done on the server, then
 * encrypted payload is transferred over tunnel to the point where SPI is wired to TROPIC01. L2 communication is
 * executed, encrypted result is transferred back to the server, where lt_in__* function is used to decrypt the
 * response.
 *
 * To have a better understanding have a look into lt_ex_hello_world.c, both examples shows similar procedure.
 *
 * This might be used for example in production, where we want to establish a secure channel between HSM and TROPIC01 on
 * PCB.

 *  - Initial power up during PCB manufacturing
 *  - Attestation key uploading
 *  - Final product usage

 * Example shows how content of config objects might be used to set different access rights and how chip behaves during

 * @brief Example usage of TROPIC01 flagship feature - 'Mac And Destroy' PIN verification engine.
 *
 * Value MACANDD_ROUNDS represents a number of possible PIN gueses, this value also affects size of lt_macandd_nvm_t
 * struct. Technically TROPIC01 is capable to have this set to 128, therefore provide 128 Mac And Destroy tries, which
 * would require roughly 128*32 bytes in non volatile memory for storing data related to M&D tries.
 *
 * In this example TROPIC01's R memory is used as a storage for data during power cycle (specifically, the last slot is
 * used). For a sake of simplicity, only one R memory slot is used as a storage, which means 444B of storage are
 * available.
 *
 * Therefore MACANDD_ROUNDS is here limited to 12 -> biggest possible number of tries which fits into 444B one R
 * memory slot.
